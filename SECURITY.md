## Security Measures

### Application Security

The iPhone App includes several security measures:

- **Helmet.js**: Comprehensive security headers
- **Content Security Policy**: Prevents XSS attacks
- **CORS Configuration**: Controlled cross-origin requests
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Secure Error Handling**: No sensitive information in error responses

### Infrastructure Security

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All production traffic uses HTTPS
- **Docker Security**: Non-root user, minimal attack surface
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored securely
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security audits of dependencies

### PWA Security

- **Service Worker Security**: Secure service worker implementation
- **Manifest Security**: Properly configured PWA manifest
- **Offline Security**: Secure offline data handling

## Security Headers

The application implements the following security headers:

```javascript
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; script-src 'self'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

## Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Output Encoding**: Properly encode outputs to prevent XSS
3. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication mechanisms
4. **Authorization**: Ensure proper access controls
5. **Secure Storage**: Never store sensitive data in plain text
6. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors

### Dependencies

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies up to date
2. **Security Audits**: Run `npm audit` regularly
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only include necessary dependencies
4. **Source Verification**: Verify the integrity of third-party packages

### Client-Side Security

1. **HTTPS Only**: Ensure all requests use HTTPS in production
2. **Sensitive Data**: Don't store sensitive data in localStorage
3. **CSP Compliance**: Ensure JavaScript complies with CSP
4. **XSS Prevention**: Use proper DOM manipulation techniques
