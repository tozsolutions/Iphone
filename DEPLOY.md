# 🚀 iPhone App - Netlify Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the iPhone App to Netlify successfully.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with the iPhone App code
- Netlify account (free tier is sufficient)
- Domain name (optional, Netlify provides a free subdomain)

## 🔧 Netlify Configuration

The repository is already configured for Netlify deployment with:

### `netlify.toml` Configuration
```toml
[build]
  publish = "src/public"
  functions = "netlify/functions"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/server/api/:splat"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/health"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/server/health"
  status = 200
```

### Directory Structure
```
src/
├── public/           # Static files (HTML, CSS, JS, PWA assets)
│   ├── index.html   # Main application
│   ├── manifest.json # PWA manifest
│   ├── sw.js        # Service worker
│   ├── css/         # Stylesheets
