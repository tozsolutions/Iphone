# Contributing to iPhone App

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

* We use SwiftLint to enforce Swift style and conventions
* Follow the existing code style in the project
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Add comments for complex logic
* Keep functions small and focused

## Testing

* Write unit tests for new functionality
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Aim for at least 80% code coverage
* Include both positive and negative test cases

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/tozsolutions/Iphone/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/tozsolutions/Iphone/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Use SwiftLint configuration provided in the repository
* Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
* Use meaningful commit messages
